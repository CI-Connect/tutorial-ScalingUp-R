[title]: - "Scaling up compute resources"
[TOC]


## Overview

Scaling up the computational resources is a big advantage for doing
certain large scale calculations on OSG. Consider the extensive
sampling for a multi-dimensional Monte Carlo integration or molecular
dynamics simulation with several initial conditions. These type of
calculations require submitting lot of jobs.

In the previous example, we submitted the job to a single worker
machine. About a million CPU hours per day are available to OSG users
on an opportunistic basis.  Learning how to scale up and control large
numbers of jobs to realizing the full potential of distributed high
throughput computing on the OSG.

In this section, we will see how to scale up the calculations with
simple example. Once we understand the basic HTCondor script, it is easy
to scale up.

### Background

For this example, we will use computational methods to estimate pi. First,
we will define a square inscribed by a unit circle from which we will 
randomly sample points. The ratio of the points outside the circle to 
the points in the circle is calculated which approaches pi/4. 

This method converges extremely slowly, which makes it great for a 
CPU-intensive exercise (but bad for a real estimation!).

## Set up an R Job

First, we'll need to create a working directory, you can either run 
`$ tutorial ScalingUp-R` or type the following:

    $ mkdir tutorial-ScalingUp-R
    $ cd tutorial-ScalingUp-R

### Test the R Script

Create an R script by typing the following into a file called `mcpi.R`:

	montecarloPi <- function(trials) {
	  count = 0
	  for(i in 1:trials) {
	    if((runif(1,0,1)^2 + runif(1,0,1)^2)<1) {
	      count = count + 1
		    }
	  }
	  return((count*4)/trials)
	}
	
	montecarloPi(1000)

Now, test your R script to ensure it runs as expected:

	$ module load r
	$ Rscript --no-save mcpi.R
	[1] 3.14

If we were running a more intensive script, we would want to test our pipeline 
with a shortened, test script first.

Now that we know our script works as expected, we can begin building the 
necessary scripts so we can run the jobs on OSG.

### Build the HTCondor Job

As discussed in the Run R Jobs tutorial, we need to prepare the job 
execution and the job submission scripts. First, make a wrapper script 
called `R-wrapper.sh`. 

	#!/bin/bash

	module load r
	Rscript --no-save mcpi.R

This script will load the required module and execute our R script.

Test the wrapper script to ensure it works:

	$ ./R-wrapper.sh mcpi.R
	[1] 3.14524

Now that we have both our R script and wrapper script written and tested, 
we can begin building the submit file for our job. If we want to submit several 
jobs, we need to track log, out and error files for each
job. An easy way to do this is to use the Cluster and Process ID
values to create unique files for each process in our job.

Create a submit file named `R.submit`:

	executable = R-wrapper.sh
	arguments = mcpi.R $(Process)
	transfer_input_files = mcpi.R     # mcpi.R is the R program we want to run
		
	log = log/job.log.$(Cluster).$(Process)
	error = log/job.error.$(Cluster).$(Process)
	output = log/job.out.$(Cluster).$(Process)  
		
	requirements = HAS_MODULES == True && OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 7" && Arch == "X86_64"
	queue 100

Note the `queue 100`.  This tells Condor to enqueue 100 copies of this job
as one cluster. Also, notice the use of `$(Cluster)` and `$(Process)` to specify unique 
output files. HTCondor will replace these with the Cluster and Process ID numbers for each 
individual process within the cluster. Let's make the `log` directory that will 
hold these files for us.

	$ mkdir log

Now it is time to submit our job! You'll see something like the following upon submission:

	$ condor_submit R.submit
	Submitting job(s).........................
	100 job(s) submitted to cluster 837.

Apply your `condor_q` and `connect watch` knowledge to see this job
progress. Check your `log` folder to see the individual output files.

### Post processâ‹…

Once the jobs are completed, you can use the information in the output files 
to calculate an average of all of our computed estimates of Pi.

To see this, we can use the command:

	$ cat mcpi*.out | awk '{ sum += $2; print $2"   "NR} END { print "---------------\n Grand Average = " sum/NR }'

## Key Points
- [x] Scaling up the computational resources on OSG is crucial to taking full advantage of grid computing.
- [x] Changing the value of `Queue` allows the user to scale up the resources.
- [x] `Arguments` allows you to pass parameters to a job script.
- [x] `$(Cluster)` and `$(Process)` can be used to name log files uniquely.
